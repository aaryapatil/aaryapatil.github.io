Google Summer of Code 2017
======

I wrote several posts during the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2017 program to document my work and the wonderful journey. The project can be found in the GSoC archive here: [AstroPy: A mixin protocol for seamless interoperability](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2017/projects/4778482366152704/) and the final report can be found here: [GSoC 2017 report](https://aaryapatil.wordpress.com/2017/08/28/a-mixin-protocol-for-seamless-interoperability/).

Other posts can be found on my old website: [GSoC 2017 posts](https://aaryapatil.wordpress.com/category/google-summer-of-code-2017/).
