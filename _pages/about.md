I am an LSST Discovery Alliance Catalyst Postdoctoral Fellow at the Max Planck
Institute for Astronomy, Germany. I have a PhD in Astronomy & Astrophysics 
from the University of Toronto (UofT) and a BEng in Computer Engineering 
from S. P. Pune University (India). My research lies at the intersection of 
astrophysics, statistics, and computer science. I develop novel statistical 
and computational tools to understand how galaxies like our own Milky Way (MW) 
form and evolve.

In the Milky Way, billion-star observations have opened avenues to study the 
complex interplay between processes that build disk galaxies. The Sun's 
position in the disk of our Galaxy allows us to observe a large number 
of stars, but these observations only cover a part of the disk. Additionally, 
the data are noisy, high-dimensional, and heterogeneous, making it challenging 
to model processes underlying the Milky Way. My work tackles these challenges 
by bridging the gap between astrophysics and statistics, and developing novel 
data-driven tools that guide models of Galaxy formation and evolution. My 
[Research](https://aaryapatil.github.io/research/)
page provides more details on my work.

I believe in the power of open science and strive to develop well-documented,
well-maintained open-source software packages for the data science methods I
develop. I also have six years of experience developing software for 
[Astropy](https://www.astropy.org/), the most widely-used open-source Python
package for astronomy. I hold several leadership positions in the Astropy
project. You can visit my Software page for more details.

I am also passionate about teaching, mentoring, and outreach. I have taught 
courses and mentored students in astrophysics, data science, and 
computer engineering. In addition, I have organized outreach activities across 
Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America. More details can be found on my 
[Teaching](https://aaryapatil.github.io/teaching/) and
[Outreach](https://aaryapatil.github.io/outreach/) pages.
