I am a PhD student at the [David A. Dunlap Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics](https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/) and the [Dunlap Institute for Astronomy & Astrophysics](https://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto. Prior to this, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at the Savitribai Phule Pune University in India. My research lies at the intersection of astrophysics, computer science and statistics. I perform large-scale data driven studies to understand how disk galaxies like the Milky Way form and evolve. Such a galaxy is shown in the following Hubble Space Telescope photograph - galaxy UGC 2885:

*Fun fact: I wrote the first open-source implementation that allows the storage/retrieval of time coordinates in the Hubble Space Telescope and several other telescope data following a generic and instrument independent way!* 

This was done when I worked as a student developer for [AstroPy](https://www.astropy.org/) under the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) 2017 program. I am now a long term AstroPy contributor and an avid open source developer. I believe in the power of open science and strive to develop well-documented, well-maintained code with proper comments(!).
