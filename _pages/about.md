I am an LSST Discovery Alliance Catalyst Postdoctoral Fellow at the Max Planck
Institute for Astronomy, Germany. I have a PhD in Astronomy & Astrophysics 
from the University of Toronto (UofT) and a BEng in Computer Engineering 
from S. P. Pune University (India).

My research lies at the intersection of astrophysics, statistics, and computer 
science. I develop novel statistical and computational tools to understand how 
galaxies like our own Milky Way (MW) form and evolve. My 
[Research](https://aaryapatil.github.io/research/) page provides more details 
on this exciting work!

I believe in the power of open science and strive to develop well-documented,
well-maintained open-source software packages for the data science methods I
develop. I also have six years of experience developing software for 
[Astropy](https://www.astropy.org/), the most widely-used open-source Python
package for astronomy. I hold several leadership positions in the Astropy
project. You can visit my Software page for more details.

I am also passionate about teaching, mentoring, and outreach. I have taught 
courses and mentored students in astrophysics, data science, and 
computer engineering. In addition, I have organized outreach activities across 
Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America. More details can be found on my 
[Teaching](https://aaryapatil.github.io/teaching/) and
[Outreach](https://aaryapatil.github.io/outreach/) pages.
