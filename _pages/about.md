I am a PhD candidate in the [David A. Dunlap Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics](https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/) and the [Dunlap Institute for Astronomy & Astrophysics](https://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto. I am also a
[Data Sciences Institute Doctoral Student Fellow](https://datasciences.utoronto.ca/doctoral-student-fellowships/) at the University of Toronto. Prior to this, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer
Engineering at the Savitribai Phule Pune University in India. My research lies at the
intersection of astrophysics, computer science, and statistics. I perform large-scale
data-driven studies to understand how disk galaxies like the Milky Way form and evolve.

I focus on the development and application of novel statistical and computational
methods in the field of Galaxy formation and evolution. I wrote a pure Python
implementation of Functional Principal Component Analysis, available on my
[GitHub profile](https://github.com/aaryapatil/specdims), to remove systematics
and reduce the dimensionality of APOGEE **spectroscopic** data. I have developed
my own Python package, [tapify](https://github.com/aaryapatil/tapify) for Multitaper
Spectral Analysis as part of my work on time series analysis for **asteroseismology**.
I am currently developing a package that combines innovative statistical methods,
copulas and elictiable maps, for estimating the age and chemical distribution of
stars in the Milky Way disk. My [Research](https://aaryapatil.github.io/research/)
page provides more details on my work.

I believe in the power of open science and strive to develop well-documented,
well-maintained code for my research. My work in open-source started as a
Google Summer of Code 2017 student developer with Astropy, the largest
open-source Python software in astronomy. I now hold leadership positions
in the project as a finance committee member, voting member, and core
contributor (ranked 32nd in total contributions). In the summer of 2021,
I mentored a [Google Summer of Code project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5695079907328000)
with Astropy under the OpenAstronomy umbrella organization. I am also mentoring Jiayi Sun,
a PhD student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at the University of
Toronto, on a project to improve the collaboration efficiency of open-source scientific
software teams.

Throughout my PhD, I have engaged in several equity, diversity, inclusion and
outreach activities. I recently developed and ran a week-long Python/Astropy
workshop on astronomical data analysis for the postgraduate stream of the
[Pan-African School for Emerging Astronomers](https://www.paseaafrica.org/), Zambia,
in October 2022. More details can be found on my [Outreach](https://aaryapatil.github.io/outreach/)
page.
