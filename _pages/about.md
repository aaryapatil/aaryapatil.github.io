I am Aarya / आर्या. I am a PhD candidate at the [David A. Dunlap Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics](https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/) and the [Dunlap Institute for Astronomy & Astrophysics](https://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto. Prior to this, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at the Savitribai Phule Pune University in India. My research lies at the intersection of astrophysics, computer science and statistics. I perform large-scale data driven studies to understand how disk galaxies like the Milky Way form and evolve.

In 2021, I was elected as a [voting member](https://www.astropy.org/team.html#votingmembers) of Astropy, a core Python package for Astronomy. In the summer of 2021, I mentored a [Google Summer of Code project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5695079907328000) with Astropy under the OpenAstronomy umbrella organization. I previously worked as a student developer for Astropy under the [Google Summer of Code 2017](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2017/projects/4778482366152704/) program. I am an avid open source developer and have contributed to other open source organizations like [NumPy](https://numpy.org/).

I am also interested in the development and application of novel statistical techniques in astronomy. I recently wrote a pure Python implementation of Functional Principal Component Analysis, available on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/aaryapatil/specdims), to reduce the dimensionality of [APOGEE spectroscopic data](https://www.sdss.org/surveys/apogee-2/). A paper on this work has been submitted to the Astrophysical Journal. I am currently developing a Python package for Multitaper Spectral Analysis as part of my thesis work on time series analysis for Asteroseismology. I plan to release it soon alongside a paper describing the work. I believe in the power of open science and strive to develop well-documented, well-maintained code with proper comments(!).
