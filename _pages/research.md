*My research bridges the gap between astronomy and statistics through the development of innovative data-driven tools that help us learn the history of galaxies.*

Galaxies are the fundamental building blocks in the structure of the Universe. Not only do their observations help us in understanding our own galaxy, the Milky Way, but they also lend themselves as giant and powerful laboratories to study the fundamental laws of physics. The *Big Bang Theory* of the origin of the universe and the existence of *Dark Matter* are some of the biggest breakthroughs in physics and they arose through studies of galaxies. Understanding galaxies is therefore an important astrophysical pursuit, and we now have petabytes of observational data to fully do so.  The only remaining element which I will address head-on is to accelerate our understanding through sophisticated Machine Learning algorithms and other modern statistical methods.

Also, galaxies are beautiful!

In addition, I also work on star formation and stellar evolution by investigating *Star Clusters*. A star cluster consists of stars that were born out of the same giant molecular cloud at the same time. These remain gravitationally bound for a limited period of time and investigating them during this time provides several opportunities to model star formation and stellar evolution theories in detail. I investigate the age and chemistry of individual stars in open clusters, star clusters found in the disk, to decode properties of the star-forming gas.

Currently, I am working on the development of a new *Likelihood-free Inference technique* that will allow us to accurately and precisely measure the chemistry of stars. I am also working on astronomical *Time Series Analysis* to estimate precise ages of stars.
