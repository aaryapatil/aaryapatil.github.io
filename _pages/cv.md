I hail from sunny Pune, a city in Maharashtra, India, where I obtained my B.E. in Computer Engineering at the Savitribai Phule Pune University in 2018. I then became a part of the Astronomy & Astrophysics Department at the University of Toronto as a PhD (Direct-Entry) student. I am currently starting my 3rd year in the program and have passed my General Qualifying Exams. I plan to defend my thesis proposal in Fall 2020 and achieve PhD candidacy.

My Professional Interests are:
-----------------------------

* Astrostatistics and Astroinformatics
* Milky Way formation & evolution
* Open-source software development - contributing member of the AstroPy project
* Teaching software development and statistical analysis skills to scientists
* Educational equity and inclusivity
